# Congratulations!

You have just learned the **basics of navigating Pinnacles admin dashboard** and **creating a course in Stripe**. ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰

Anything **unclear** or **buggy** in this tutorial? Please report it.

## What next? (optional)
- You can go back to the participant dashboard, and double check if the information is correctly displayed.
- You can book a course and pay for it.

:::note
If you sign out and go back to the marketing pages, you will see that none of the courses you created is display.

This is because we are using a separate storage to keep our web application as **free** as possible.

Inform IT to update the marketing page with the new course.
